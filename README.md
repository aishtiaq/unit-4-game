# unit-4-game

This game uses concepts from Math.random() and dynamically updated the DOM using jQuery. It also utilizes the on click method.

The concept is simple, on every crystal click, the randomly assigne value of the gem is added to the total score.
If the score matches the randomly generated computer guess, user wins. Otherwise, they lose. In both cases, the game resets but the wins and losses tally keeps running.
